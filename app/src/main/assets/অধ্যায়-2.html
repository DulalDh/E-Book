<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Literature Review</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.1 Introduction </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A literature review is used to evaluate report of information found in the previous related works to a selected area of study. The review should describe summaries, evaluate and clarify this previous related works. In this respect, for our system we review some related works in below sections. This Review articles provide an overview of recent and past&nbsp; research focused on an issue or problem</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Review of the Related Work</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; The literature related to the research topic has been reviewed for last six years in order to find out work carried out by various researchers. There are many systems for information system and location tracking as commercial products or experimental research platforms. Which are noticed that most of the research given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.1 (</strong><strong>P. Suganya and T. Karthija </strong><strong>2017) </strong>Proposed system &nbsp;needs student&rsquo;s details for verifying the authorized students and this application gets the information about the buses like bus numbers, bus routes for the students. The web server utilize the technology of Location Based Services, which helps to track the current location of the bus and it estimates if any deviation occurs in the bus route using the Client-Server technology. Each bus sends its current location to the web server. This information is stored on the server database. The students who installed the college bus tracking application can track the bus routes, bus location and the arrival time of the bus using Kalman filter algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.2 (Manish Kumar Kushwaha, Manish Sharma 2014) </strong>Proposed project to Design of Computerized Automated Management System, to speed up and make it easy to use system. It reduces the manpower needed to perform the entire admission and administration task by reducing the paper works needed. The main goal of the system is to automate the process carried out in the organization with improved performance and realize the vision of paperless work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.3 (Mr. Kshirsagar Suraj Shashikant Mr. Gaikwad Amit Bajrang 2015)</strong> Proposed smart tracking System is an Android based application for travelers to obtain the geo-location and tag it with multimedia features. This application allows users to create, store and view their Vehicles, Vehicle related information and all the memories that bring with it. Vehicle Tracker Combines places visited, notes taken and the images captured, and display all this information on a map at the exact location where it all took place. This application is developed to provide the users a rich user experience by having all the information in one place, easyto-access and interactive. With the help of Google Maps, each Vehicle can be drawn out on the map with all the locations visited and the route taken. The user will also be able to view the description, the location address and the image captured any. Vehicle Tracker, developed in Android, provides extensive flexibility, supports many features and can be among thebest travel friendly app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.4 ( Aldrin.N.Thomas</strong>, <strong>Akhil Babu,</strong> <strong>Stalin.G.Thayil, Vyshnav Ambadan 2013)</strong> This application will be designed to maximize the ease of use of official website of aisat in mobile view. Specifically, the application is designed to communicate and to notify the updates from the college website. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of albertians .The application will facilitate communication between students and the faculties via database. Application forms for different collage activities is provided from the application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.5 (Pritesh Bharnuke, Abhishek Kshirsagar, Sagar Parmar 2014) </strong>This Project it is designed on an embedded system which is used for tracking and positioning of any vehicle by using GPS tracking system is required in many situations, when you need to track the vehicle or the convoy of vehicles ,it could be theft or highjack case. In GPS tracking system the location of vehicle is sent to remote place and it is done by GSM modem. GPS modem requires minimum 3 satellites to calculate the exact location. This modem communicates only in one way with microcontroller. This means that it can only transmit data to microcontroller. GPS Modem does not receive any data from microcontroller. At the same time GPS modem does not send data to Satellite, it only receives signal from satellites.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.6 (Kapil Kaushik, Ankur Agarwal, Tushar Somani 2011) </strong>Student Information Management System can be used by education institutes to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.7 (Patil, Harshal, Rajendra 2016)</strong> Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) is the technology used to determine the location of a vehicle using methods like GPS and other radio navigation systems operating through satellites and ground based stations. By following triangulation or trilateration methods the tracking system enables to calculate easy and accurate location of the vehicle. Vehicle information like location details, speed, distance raveled etc. can be viewed on a digital mapping with the help of a software via Internet. This system is an important tool for tracking each vehicle at a given period of time and now it is becoming increasingly popular for people having expensive cars and hence as a theft prevention and retrieval device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2.8 (Sujit Shelar, ShivrajTelangi, Sanmeet Bamane 2015) &nbsp;</strong>It&rsquo;s an upcoming idea of Location based Services &amp; can be used in day to day life application is the most challenging part. Defining this application we can study &amp; implement the current technologies used in development &amp; useful for our career. We are going to use GPS for locating the position of vehicle. We will also find the speed of the vehicle in real time to find whether a driver is adhering to the speed limits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.3 Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of what a literature review text tells a reader, all types of literature reviews have some similar purposes. Same this way, there are some related purposes which are same to make a suitable college information with tracking system. For professionals, those are useful reports that keep them up to date with current and previous works in the field.</p> <br> <br>
