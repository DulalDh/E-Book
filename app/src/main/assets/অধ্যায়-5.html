<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>System Design</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.1&nbsp; </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter, discus about system design and the system design is divided into three part such as architectural design, logical design and physical design. Systems design is a systematic approach to the design of a system. It may take a bottom-up or top-down approach, but either way the process is systematic wherein it takes into account all related variables of the system that needs to be created&mdash;from the architecture, to the required hardware and software, right down to the data and how it travels and transforms throughout its travel through the system. Systems design then overlaps with systems analysis, systems engineering and systems architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.2 Architectural Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The architectural design of a system emphasizes the design of the&nbsp;system architecture&nbsp;that describes the&nbsp;structure,&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and more&nbsp;views&nbsp;of that system and analysis. Requirements of the software should be transformed into an architecture that describes the software's top-level structure and identifies its components. This is accomplished through architectural design (also called&nbsp;<strong>system design),&nbsp;</strong>which acts as a preliminary 'blueprint' from which software can be developed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Class diagram:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Class diagram&nbsp;describes the attributes and operations of a&nbsp;class&nbsp;and also the constraints imposed on the system. The&nbsp;class diagrams&nbsp;are widely used in the modeling of object oriented systems because they are the only UML&nbsp;diagrams, which can be mapped directly with object-oriented languages.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.3 Logical design</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system. This is often conducted via modelling, using an over-abstract (and sometimes graphical) model of the actual system. In the context of systems, designs are included. Logical design includes&nbsp;entity-relationship diagrams&nbsp;logical design is critical to the implementation of a corporate database. If your logical design is incomplete or has flaws, making changes to the means of data collection, storage, and protection can be costly later on. By using a well-conceived preliminary design, you can easily implement and test a database. A sound logical design therefore helps to ensure a successful implementation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.4 Physical design</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is processed, and how it is displayed. In physical design, the following requirements about the system are decided. During the&nbsp;physical design process, you convert the data gathered during the logical&nbsp;design&nbsp;phase into a description of the&nbsp;physical&nbsp;database, including tables and constraints.&nbsp;Physical design&nbsp;decisions, such as the type of index or partitioning have a large impact on query performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data follow Diagram:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is traditional visual representation of the information flows within a system. A neat and clear DFD can depict a good amount of the system requirements graphically. It can be manual, automated, or combination of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It shows how information enters and leaves the system, what changes the information and where information is stored. The purpose of a DFD is to show the scope and boundaries of a system as a whole. It may be used as a communications tool between a systems analyst and any person who plays a part in the system that acts as the starting point for redesigning a system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is usually beginning with a context diagram as the level 0 of DFD diagram, a simple representation of the whole system. To elaborate further from that, we drill down to a level 1 diagram with lower level functions decomposed from the major functions of the system. This could continue to evolve to become a level 2 diagram when further analysis is required. Three (zero, first &amp; second) level DFD show in following figure:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.5 Choosing Implementation Model </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Implementation models are used in each system. There are many models in the present world and they have a lot of different steps that can be used to make the system properly. That's why we are also used waterfall model for our system that show in following</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Waterfall Model </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The waterfall model is a sequential design process, used in software development&nbsp; processes, in</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards&nbsp; (like a waterfall) through&nbsp; the phases of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing , Production/Implementation&nbsp; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maintenance. The waterfall development&nbsp; model originates in the manufacturing and construction&nbsp; industries: &nbsp;highly structured physical environments&nbsp; in which after-the-fact changes are prohibitively costly,&nbsp; if not impossible. Since no formal software development&nbsp; methodologies existed at the time, this hardware-oriented&nbsp; model was simply adapted for software development</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why use the waterfall model</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This model is simple and easy to understand and use. In, this model phases are processed and completed&nbsp; one at a time and phases do not overlap. Waterfall model works well for smaller projects where sequence are very well understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.6 </strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter process model was introduced and used to design a high level framework on top of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API).&nbsp; It was decided during analysis that a database application would also be developed to test the framework.&nbsp; This will enable the framework to be evaluated and possibly determine any additional functionality required.</p>
