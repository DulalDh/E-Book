<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of information System is to allow the administrator of any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a student and allows the student, teacher and employee &nbsp;to keep update his profile . It will facilitate keeping all the records of teachers and students, such as name, mailing address, phone number, department etc. It will be used to access college website without any browser. This application have gallery, notice board, admission information, campus history and control panel. So all the information about SASTC College will be available in a few seconds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; This app will be used to track college bus location. Bus information like location details, speed, distance traveled etc. can be viewed on a digital mapping with the help of a software via web server. The web server utilize the technology of Location Based Services, which helps to track the current location of the bus and it estimates if any deviation occurs in the bus route using the Client-Server technology. Each bus sends its current location to the web server. This information is stored on the server database. The students who installed the college bus tracking application can track the bus routes, bus location and the arrival time of the bus using Kalman filter algorithm. The bus location is tracked by using global positioning system and the location information is send to the students in the Google map which reduces their waiting time. For location tracking is used extra one application called bus application. This bus application is installed in driver phone.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.2 </strong><strong>Objective of the project</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>To provide information about teacher, student, employee, college history and admission.</li>
<li>To track exact location of the college bus.</li>
<li>To provide control panel for control overall system.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.4 Scope of the project</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This project is very useful for students, teachers and employee through the application. In this application describe a network for distributing campus information among teacher, students and employee. The concept of developing college information system is to ensure that student can access information at any time, at any locations and ad-hoc basic. These applications also show the college bus location so the user can track college bus at any time. Since all users know the location of the bus so they do not have to wait for the bus. This application uses client-server technology to access location and information. The bus send its current location to the web server and information is stored on the server database. The students who installed the college bus tracking application can track the bus routes, bus location and the arrival time of the bus using Kalman filter algorithm. To access admin module must be entered user id and password. This module is used to control overall system such as update and delete information and maintain location tracking system. This module is used to&nbsp; update college notice board, gallery and college information by the database</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.5 Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Now everyone is using smart phones and smart phone applications are running out of use. So our project is on the smart phone application. With this app, all information about the college campus can be known and controlled. This application provide online notice board and gallery which is updated by control panel. This application also show exact location of the college bus.</p>
