<h3 id="N100DA" class="ibm-h3">Chapter 12</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you program for the Java platform, you write source code in .java files and then compile them. The compiler checks your code against the language's syntax rules, then writes out&nbsp;<em>bytecode</em>&nbsp;in .class files. Bytecode is a set of instructions targeted to run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). In adding this level of abstraction, the Java compiler differs from other language compilers, which write out instructions suitable for the CPU chipset the program will run on.</p>
<h3 id="N100E4" class="ibm-h3">The JVM</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At runtime, the JVM reads and interprets .class files and executes the program's instructions on the native hardware platform for which the JVM was written. The JVM interprets the bytecode just as a CPU would interpret assembly-language instructions. The difference is that the JVM is a piece of software written specifically for a particular platform. The JVM is the heart of the Java language's "write-once, run-anywhere" principle. Your code can run on any chipset for which a suitable JVM implementation is available. JVMs are available for major platforms like Linux and Windows, and subsets of the Java language have been implemented in JVMs for mobile phones and hobbyist chips.</p>
<h3 id="N100EB" class="ibm-h3">The garbage collector</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than forcing you to keep up with memory allocation (or use a third-party library to do so), the Java platform provides memory management out of the box. When your Java application creates an object instance at runtime, the JVM automatically allocates memory space for that object from the&nbsp;<em>heap</em>&mdash; a pool of memory set aside for your program to use. The Java&nbsp;<em>garbage collector</em>&nbsp;runs in the background, keeping track of which objects the application no longer needs and reclaiming memory from them. This approach to memory handling is called&nbsp;<em>implicit memory management</em>&nbsp;because it doesn't require you to write any memory-handling code. Garbage collection is one of the essential features of Java platform performance.</p><br><br>
