<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion and </strong><strong>Future Scope</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.1 Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it can seem that, what we have done with our system that is not our target system actually. Especially we had proposed an tracking device for location tracking and also proposed an user chatting system, which are currently in under construction. So that, we are working for make an user chatting system and insert a device into bus with our system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We already mentioned the advantages of college information with bus location tracking in our paper, but apart from the advantages it also has some limitations to use. The main limitations of this system are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation costs: To implement </strong>bus location tracking system is bring a huge financial cost. In this system is used two application such as user application and driver application. So require one android phone for driver application. The android phone is very costly. The cost is &nbsp;reduce by using tracking device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>System crash occur for interconnection: </strong>If there is any damage due to rupturing in connection module then entire system gets crashed. This will be the case of radio signals or the other signals. There may be a problem of signal receiving/sending for gateway, server or application. The server of the system results in crash in most of the systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network problem:</strong> Scenario of our country network system is very bad. It is very common to fall of network in various area of our country. As our entire system fully dependent on internet network, so that if there is no internet the system will fail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Human errors:</strong> human errors may occur, if the human does not handle the application safely or does not provide the correct input to perform the operations. Human errors also lead to destructions of the system. Then there will be a huge loss of &nbsp;time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reliability:</strong> It seems that, the reliability of the college information with bus location tracking system may vary in different situation. It depends mostly on the technology used and the advancements being done or methodology being used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.3 Objective Achieve</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">College information such as teachers information, students information, employee information, college history and admission information are achieve. User can track exact location of the college bus and predict the arrival time of the bus from the user current location are achieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.4 </strong><strong>Future scope</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently the application will be working as online application which includes the features like bus tracking system ,which allows the users to track the bus and this feature is very helpful as it emphasis on security .The college management can also utilize this feature for better college bus service. Future the application will be working The registered SASTCian&nbsp; user would be provided a chat on facility for communication. Application also integrate advanced students teachers communication for better utilization of the application .Parents teachers communication may also be developed. Attendance percentage calculator can be introduced. Assignments can be submitted through online, and mailed etc. We will Use tracking device for bus location in future. Artificial intelligence will be used for the live chatting of the system with the user.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.5 </strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The era of mobile technology opens the windows to the android app. The websites are vanishing and the smart phones are emerging .It is time to change from conventional websites to apps which has become the part of our daily routine. We are introducing &ldquo;SASTCollege.apk&rdquo; the android application software which would be a miniature of our college website. It works not only as a website, but also it can work as a location tracking of the college bus.</p>
